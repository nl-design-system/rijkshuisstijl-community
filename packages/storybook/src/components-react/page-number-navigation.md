# Rijkshuisstijl Community Page Number Navigation component

Page Number Navigation is a navigation element used to navigate between multiple pages of overview lists. This is commonly used for search results or a list of news articles. In cases where overview lists are too long to display on a single page, pagination can provide a clearer and more functional way to divide the content across multiple pages. Pagination indicates the current page and allows users to navigate to other pages.
