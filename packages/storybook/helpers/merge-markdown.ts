 * Replaces all occurrences of the target string in the provided markdown text with the specified replacement string.
 * The target is replaced only when it appears as a whole word, ensuring it's not part of another word.
 *
 * The function uses a regular expression with word boundaries to match the target only when it is surrounded by spaces,
 * punctuation, or at the start/end of the string. The replacement is case-insensitive and global, meaning it will replace
 * all instances of the target in the text.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Replaces specific words or phrases in markdown text without affecting words that contain the target string.
 * - Ensures case-insensitive and global replacements across the entire markdown text.
